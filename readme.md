# HTTP5203 XML Project - Ticket System
### HTTP5203 - Individual Assignment
#### Description:

- For an XML course, I was required to create 2 XML files for a support ticket system: one for users that login and one for tickets. For each XML file, an XML Schema was created to define the structure for each file.

- Once those XML files were created and populated with mock data, I was required to use PHP to create a functional support ticket system application using the data from the XML files. This included a login/logout function, displaying of tickets (user specific), ability to create a ticket, respond to tickets, and status of close/re-open exisiting tickets.

## Tools:

- XML
- Schemaa
